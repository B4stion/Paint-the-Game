# Paint the Game

This project is a 3D platforming and puzzle solving game created on the Unity game engine.  It was made as a collaborative project 
in the Video Game Programming course at Washington University in St. Louis.  The game features a freeform "painting" mechanic that allows
the player to draw objects with their mouse that can then be used as platforms or for other purposes.  The game includes a tutorial
and nine unique levels.
